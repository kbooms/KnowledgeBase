# Datatypes and Variables

## A brief overview of Variables
Typical programs like web applications need to store and manipulate data.  
Variables have three characteristics:  
- A variable must identify what **type of data** it stores
- A variable must be declared before it's used
- A variable must be given a unique name
  
We've mentioned already that variables must be declared, but it also must have data initialized within it before it can be used.  
  
Declaring a variable `Datatype variableName;`  
Initializing data `variableName = initialData;`  
  
However variable can be declared and initialized on the same line  
Example code format `Datatype variableName = someData;`
  
## Data types
Every variable, when created, is defined with a data type. The data type classifies the variable and indicates the particular type of data that a particular variable holds.  
In Java, there are two classifications of data types: **primitive** and **reference** data types. Primitive data types store values such as `42`, `true`, or `a`. These data values consume a fixed amount of memory. A reference type stores complex data, such as entries in an address book, or product inventory in a computer system.  
*We'll learn more about reference variables in a later lesson. For now we will focus on primitive types.*
